In addition to the Blender anomaly detection, we analyzed new music addition results from Bailando both qualitatively and quantitatively. Overall due to not changing the root dance videos, we noticed a drastic difference in the metric score performance (defined by AIST++) between the original test and our test set. The new music additions were reevaluated under the reinforcement learning portion and due to the new music involving lyrics and a larger range of BPMs, the model was challenged to optimize the beat-alignment reward function. The video found in this folder is the SMPL 3D-defined skeletal figure (without human mesh) generated video from pkl file that includes a very famous bachata song. This video is a classic example of displaying how since the root dance video was under different music conditions(in this case hip-hop with an emphasis on break dancing), the model tried its best to align those dance sequences to another song and while technically it did follow the normal dance style, it still received higher qualitative scores compared to its counterpart.
