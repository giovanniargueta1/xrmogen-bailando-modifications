# xrmogen_colab_tutorial
The notebook shows the appropriate steps to run the Baliando/DanceRev model (from Xrmogen framework) on Google Colab.

All code in the train_bailando.ipynb file sets up the Python virtual environment to train/test both models available in Xrmogen, but it only displays the commands for Bailando. Please
reference the original repo to mimic the commands for testing/training DanceRev.
